# Some Problems

### In order to run them

I've included the .class files as well in order to run them directly

```bash
cd .class
java {filename}
```

### To build and run

```bash
cd .java
javac {filename}.java
java {filename}
```


### Questions to filename mappings

1. Q1 -> SingleLL.java 
2. Q2 -> Rectangles.java
3. Q3 -> Sequences.java
4. Q4 -> Thief.java
